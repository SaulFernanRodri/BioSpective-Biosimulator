		<p>Recent computational methodologies, such as agent-based
			modelling, support the search for explanatory insight into the
			collective behaviour of molecules and bring forward the discussion of
			intrinsic noise while simulating biological events. The present work
			contributes to this line of research by assembling and validating a
			molecular-scale agent-based model for the simulation of enzymatic
			reactions at experimentally measured concentrations. The model
			incorporates stochasticity and spatial dependence, using diffusing
			and reacting particles with physical dimensions. We started by
			adjusting the information from classical theories, namely enzymatic
			rates and diffusion coefficients, to the information required by the
			computational agents, i.e. collision efficiency, interaction logic
			between agents, the time scale associated with interactions (e.g.
			kinetics), and agent velocity. We developed specific strategies to
			implement the model in a way that could use and reproduce
			experimental measures of diffusion and kinetics, in the form of
			Michaelis-Menten parameters. The velocity of the agents was defined
			in an iterative manner to match the corresponding theoretical
			diffusion coefficients.</p>
		<p>
			Agents capable of diffusion and reaction take on physical dimensions
			based on the data reported by scientific literature and the <a
				href="http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/" target="_BLANK">BRENDA
				database</a>. Enzymes and metabolites are represented by agents with
			spherical approximations (by the hydrodynamic or van der Walls
			radius) of the excluded volume of the biomolecules. The diffusion
			coefficients were calculated using the Stokes-Einstein equation for
			diffusion of spherical particles in a liquid.
		</p>
		<p>Enzymatic reactions are defined by the computational parameters
			simkcat, simKm and reaction radius. The simkcat is the number of time
			steps between the formation of enzyme-substrate reaction complex and
			the product release. The simKm quantifies the probability of a
			successful collision between an interacting enzyme and substrate.
			And, the reaction radius enables the enzyme agent to detect substrate
			agents off the immediate vicinity and test more possible
			interactions.</p>
